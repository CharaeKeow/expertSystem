# expertSystem
A programming language recommendation system

## How to run?
Well, this project is written entirely on Python, so could basically run it on any platform that has Python 
installed. We developed it using Python 3.7 so running it using Python 3 would be fine, though we don't 
think that this code is executable using Python 2.

### Windows machine
1. First thing first, make sure you have Python 3 on your Windows machine. If none, download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Download all '*.py*' files. Put them in the same folder.
3. Then, open Command Prompt. [Change directory](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-Directories-in-Command-Prompt) to the directory of your file. 
4. After that, run the '*expertSystem.py*' file by doing the following command:
> ```py expertSystem.py```
5. If you can't run the file, it could be that you are at the wrong directory or there's something wrong with your Python.

### Linux machine :hearts:
1. Linux comes with Python preinstalled, so there's no need to install Python. 
2. 2. Download all '*.py*' files. Put them in the same directory.
3. Then, open terminal and [change directory](https://askubuntu.com/questions/520778/how-can-i-change-directories-in-the-terminal) to the directory of the downloaded file.
4. After that, run the '*expertSystem.py*' file by doing the following command:
> ```python3 expertSystem.py```
5. If you can't run the file, check if you're at the right directory.

### Mac machine :dollar:
1. Like Linux distros, Python is also preinstalled in Mac OS. However, it is the archaic :older_man: Python 2.7, which lags behind in some features and can't execute our program. So, consider download the latest version (3.7) [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Download all '*.py*' files. Put them in the same directory.
3. Then, open terminal and change directory(https://www.macworld.com/article/2042378/master-the-command-line-navigating-files-and-folders.html) to the directory of the downloaded file.
4. After that, run the '*expertSystem.py*' file by doing the following command:
> ```python3 expertSystem.py```
5. If you can't run the file, check if you're at the right directory.
